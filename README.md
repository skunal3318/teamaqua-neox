# Decentralized ID Verification for Gamers on Neox Blockchain

A blockchain-based Decentralized Identity Verification System (AQUA) and gaming tournament registering platform that leverages MetaMask for secure transactions and data encryption, with a robust User and Requester interface developed using React.

## Description

This project aims to provide a decentralized ID verification system for gamers on the Neox blockchain using Web3 technology and allows the user to register to register for certain events and tournaments & provides information about it to the user. The system allows gamers to create and manage their digital identities in a secure and private manner.


## Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized ID verification system that is secure, private, and easy to use for gamers. We aim to provide a platform that allows gamers to have full control over their digital identities and to enable secure and trustworthy interactions between gamers and gaming platforms.

## Features
1). Decentralized identity management using Web3 and Neox blockchain
2). Secure and private identity verification for gamers
3). Easy integration with gaming platforms and applications
4). User-friendly interface for gamers to manage their digital identities
5). Support for multiple identity verification methods (e.g. age verification, identity verification for gaming tournaments)
6). Tournament registration and management system

## Technical Details
Built using Web3 and Neox blockchain technology
Utilizes decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials
Implemented using smart contracts and blockchain-based storage


## Deployment
Deployment Steps
Install the required dependencies and tools
Set up a Neox blockchain node and configure the network
Deploy the smart contracts and initialize the system
Integrate the system with your gaming platform or application

## Prerequisites

Before installing AQUA, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser with the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/) extension installed and set up.
- An understanding of React.js and Ethereum-based DApp development is beneficial for contributing to the project.

### Phase 1: User

- **Research**: Evaluation of the feasibility of DApp integration with current technologies.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Implementing MetaMask for transaction signing and data encryption.
- **Development Stack:**
  - **Front-End**: Developed with React.js for a responsive user interface.
  - **Back-End**: Utilizes ethers.js for blockchain interactions.

### Phase 2: Requester

- **Identity Creation & Management**: Leveraging Smart Contracts for identity creation and management.
- **Verification Requests**: Requesters can initiate identity verification requests.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Incorporating Permission and Verification Contracts for secure approvals and data retrieval.

## Features

- **MetaMask Account Handling**: Automates mnemonic generation and private key provisioning for MetaMask.
- **Data Encryption & IPFS**: Encrypts identity objects and interfaces with IPFS for decentralized storage.
- **Smart Contracts**: Facilitates the mapping of user addresses to blockchain-stored CIDs and manages permissions and verifications.
- A user-friendly interface equipped with intuitive controls for all DApp functionalities.

### Installation

```
    git clone https://github.com/azazz3L/AQUA-NEOX.git
    cd Aqua_Portal
    npm install
```

## Usage

- Configure MetaMask in your browser.
- Launch AQUA:

```
    npm run dev
```

- Navigate through the UI to create an identity or submit a verification request.
